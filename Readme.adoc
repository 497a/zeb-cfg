= nixos-config

NixOS configs for various machines.

NOTE: This document is more of a unstructured notepad for me than an actual readme.

== Usage

The flake exports configurations for all my machines.

== Secrets

Secrets are managed with `agenix`. They are stored in the secrets directory.

Each machine uses its ed25519 SSH host key to decrypt its secrets. That SSH host key is also stored as a secret. Before deploying a machine for the first time the ed25519 SSH host key must be on it. For now I just copied the key over manually, but nixos-anywhere has a option to copy files to a machine, I think.

== TODO

- Manage SSH config
- Manage account passwords
