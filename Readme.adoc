= nixos-config

NixOS configs for various machines.

NOTE: This document is more of a unstructured notepad for me than an actual readme.

== Joining the antibuilding VPN

To join the VPN just add your device to machines.nix. There is a script for that in this repo. cd into the root of this repo and run

.Add your config to the repo
----
nix run .#add-antibuilding-peer -- 'YOUR HOSTNAME' 'YOUR WIREGUARD PUBLIC KEY'
----

commit the changes and open a PR. One hour after the PR gets merged, you can connect to the network. Just import the nixos module into your config.

[source,nix]
.Example for using the VPN module
----
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs?ref=nixos-unstable";
    antibuilding = {
      url = "github:zebreus/nixos-config";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, antibuilding }: {
    nixosConfigurations.trolltop = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [
        ./configuration.nix
        antibuilding.nixosModules.vpn
        # Path to the wireguard private key at runtime
        { antibuilding.customWireguardPrivateKeyFile = "/etc/nixos/antibuilding.key"; }
      ];
    };
  };
}

----

.Generate a wireguard keypair
----
wg genkey | tee wireguard_private.key
cat wireguard_private.key | wg pubkey | tee wireguard_private.key
----

== Usage

The flake exports configurations for all my machines.

== Secrets

Secrets are managed with `agenix`. They are stored in the secrets directory.

Each machine uses its ed25519 SSH host key to decrypt its secrets. That SSH host key is also stored as a secret. Before deploying a machine for the first time the ed25519 SSH host key must be on it. For now I just copied the key over manually, but nixos-anywhere has a option to copy files to a machine, I think.

== DNS / DNSSEC readme

1. Add a new zone to knot
2. Deploy the primary DNS server
3. Set the NS records in the domain registrar
4. Get the DS records from the primary DNS server by running `keymgr <zone> ds`
5. Add the DS records to the domain registrar

== TODO

- Manage SSH config
- Manage account passwords
- Write documentation
- Manage vscode config
- Upstream the part that chmods the paths created by agenix
- Unify nginx acme certs to use `enableACME` on the virtualhosts and set a default email
- connect janek-backup again
- Export a independent vpn module
- Peer with more people
- Write documentation for the VPN module
